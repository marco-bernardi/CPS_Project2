# IoT Device and Server Authentication with Secure Vaults

This repository is part of the *Cyber-Physical and IoT Security* course at the University of Padua. Its primary objective is to reproduce the authentication process between IoT devices and IoT servers using secure vaults, inspired by the methodology outlined in the following research paper:

[**Authentication of IoT Device and IoT Server Using Secure Vaults**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455985)

## Project Overview
The repository focuses on replicating and understanding the techniques presented in the paper to secure IoT communication. Secure vaults are leveraged as a foundation for robust authentication protocols between IoT devices and servers.

## Test Notebook
You can find the notebook containing the tests and demonstrations of the IoT device-server authentication process in the folder `source/auth.ipynb`. This notebook provides a hands-on experience of how the authentication and communication mechanisms between IoT devices and servers work, including secure message exchanges and vault updates.
